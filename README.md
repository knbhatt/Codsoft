This repository contains the data science projects I completed during my internship at Codsoft. The projects include Titanic survival prediction, IMDB movie rating prediction with Python, and iris flower classification.
Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction
This project focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin and whether or not they survived..

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the data directory.

Results
The best accuracy achieved was 75%.

Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

Task 2: IMDB Movie Rating Prediction with Python
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, and release year.The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or critics.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is available in the data directory.

Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn

Task 3: Iris Flower Classification
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three different species based on various features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
